# API_Hero

## üíª Project

This project is a simple API for register a task.
- It has a token authentication system.
- Only authenticated users can use the API.
- The user must be able to register new tasks, and edit or delete only their own.
- It has a registration screen (optional, if you don't want to use the admin or shell to create a user)

Below Screenshot from the browsable API:

## üöÄ Technologies

This project was developed with the following tecnologies:
- Python 3.10
- Django 3.2.9
- Django Rest Framework 3.12.4

The reason for choosing Django and Django Rest Framework was the practicality and productivity for the creation of REST API's, besides particularly liking these tools. ü•∞

The database used for this application was `sqlite3`. Because it is already installed and configured with Django, it makes development a lot easier.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Run the project**

**3. In operation**
  
Example of creating a task (with Postman):
  
![image](/readme_img/postman_post_api-todolist.png?raw=true "postman_post_api-todolist")

Update a task (with browsable API)
![image](/readme_img/drf_put_api_todolist_id.png?raw=true "drf_put_api-todolist_id")

If the user tries to update or delete a task that he did not create himself, it will not succeed and will display an error message.
![image](/readme_img/drf_put_api_todolist_id_response_error.png?raw=true "drf_put_api-todolist_response_error_id")
![image](/readme_img/drf_delete_api_todolist_id_response_error.png?raw=true "drf_delete_api-todolist_response_error_id")

The API has ordering by delivery date and searching by username. To access this resource, pass this information by parameter.
```
/api/todolist/?ordering=date&search=marco
```
